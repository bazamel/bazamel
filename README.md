ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bazamel. Freelance full-stack web developer and SEO. I run [a digital product studio called Layover](https://layover.studio).

I'm looking for new freelance missions so feel free to reach out on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/bazamel) or [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/bazamel_)!

## Testimonials

-   **Frank Rousseau** (CEO at CGWire ($400k ARR): Basile took up a new topic (animation industry) and devised a content strategy to get us to the top of our niche over the next year. He's a great writer. Super independent and a pleasure to work with.)
